Welcome to this repo. Here is my work to build an optimized kernel to 
a Dell Latitude 3550 (haswell iwlwifi/rtl nic). You can find the associated config file at 
L3550-Haswell.config

Config files for other laptop could be found here later

Some modifications have been made to kernel's makefile and Kconfig on 
arch/x86 to enables me to pass my march and mtune c_args to the kernel
at build time.

licenses of firmwares in packages and mentionned in .config files are 
available at this location: LICENSES/FirmwaresSpecifiedInConfig/

usage (non-binary):
- clone the repo 
- rename to .config (if wanted)
- and build it with:
 `make bindeb-pkg -j"$(nproc)" LOCALVERSION=-"$(dpkg --print-architecture)" KDEB_PKGVERSION="$(make kernelversion)"` 
 for debian packages
or `make -j"$(nproc)" && make -j"$(nproc)" modules` 
for local install only or any other distribution
- install resulting with:
`apt install ./<packages-name.deb>` for debian (for every packages)
`make install && make modules_install` for local install only or any other distribution
- update your bootloader
- reboot

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
