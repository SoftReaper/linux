Welcome to this repo. Here is my work to build an optimized kernel to 
my GA401IV. You can find the associated config file at GA401I.config

Some modifications have been made to kernel's makefile and Kconfig on 
arch/x86 to enables me to pass my march and mtune c_args to the kernel
at build time.

licenses of firmwares in packages and mentionned in .config files are 
available at this location: LICENSES/FirmwaresSpecifiedInConfig/

usage (non-binary):
- clone the repo 
`git clone https://github.com/SoftReaper/linux-image-5.16-znver2.git --depth 1 --branch customized`
- rename GA401I.config to .config (if wanted)
- and build it with:
 `make bindeb-pkg -j"$(nproc)" LOCALVERSION=-"$(dpkg --print-architecture)" KDEB_PKGVERSION="$(make kernelversion)-1"` 
 for debian packages
or `make -j"$(nproc)" && make -j"$(nproc)" modules` 
for local install only or any other distribution
- install resulting with:
`apt install ./<packages-name.deb>` for debian (for every packages)
`make install && make modules_install` for local install only or any other distribution
- update your bootloader
- reboot

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
